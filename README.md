# FastStyleLiveCam
Real-time video stylization using neural networks and webcam input.

- Live video stylization using pre-trained models (Mosaic, Candy, Rain Princess,... and mine trained Stormtrooper-like.)
- Switch styles on-the-fly with number keys
- Take snapshots with styled frames
- GPU acceleration (Apple M-series via Metal / MPS)

- Controls:
	•	1–6 — switch between styles
	•	s — save snapshot
	•	q — quit


Model files (.pth) are not included in the repository due to size limits.
Place them manually into the models/ folder.

run neural_live.py and have fun....
